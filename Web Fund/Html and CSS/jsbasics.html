        <h2>JavaScript Basics</h2>
        <p class="mar">JavaScript is a cross-platform,  object-oriented scripting language. JavaScript is extremely popular for a variety of reasons. It is a small and lightweight language allowing maximum flexibility for developers to lake it in a bunch of different directions. JavaScript lives inside a host environment (a web browser or Node server), it can be connected to the objects of these environments to provide programmatic control over them.
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p><a href="vardesc.html">Variable Declaration</a> JavaScript variables are containers for storing data values - imagine a cup you fill with coffee, the cup holds the coffee, a variable holes a value. All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names. These unique names are called identifiers. <span class="purple">var x;</span>
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><a href="varass.html">Variable Assignment</a> Assignment operators assign values to JavaScript variables - our cup can now have coffee poured in it, giving our variable a value to hold. The = assingment operator assings a value to a variable. <span class="purple">var x = 10;</span>
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><a href="data.html">Data Types</a> Data types are an important convept; to be able to operate on variables you need to know the data type. There are six data types that are JavaScript primitives: Boolean - <span class="purple">true</span> or <span class="purple">false;</span> null - <span class="purple">null</span> aka nothing; Number - <span class="purple">42</span> or <span class="purple">3.14159;</span> String - <span class="purple">"Coding Dojo Rocks!";</span> Array - <span class="purple">[1, 'Coding', 'Dojo'];</span> and Object - <span class="purple">{first_name: 'Jane', last_name: 'Doe'}</span>
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><a href="conditionals.html">Conditionals</a> When you wreite code, you want to perform different actions for different decisions - hitting different code blocks based on values or conditions that have been met. You can use conditional statements in your code to accomplish this. There are the following contitional statements: <span class="purple">if</span> a specified condition is true, do this code in our code block; <span class="purple">else if</span> to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false; <span class="purple">else</span> we execute this block of code;
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><a href="loops.html">Loops</a> There are many different kinds of loops in every programming language, but they all essentially do the same thing: they will repeat an action some number of times. Imagine you have to run a mile, well you run around the track four times and then you stop. That's a loop!
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><a href="function.html">Funtion</a> Functions are an encaspulation of a code block. When we call our function this will run that code block. Think of it as a list of instructions. As an example imagine we are putting together a desk from Ikea, we open up the instruction manual and get started, first we screw the legs to the table top; next we place the table the right way up. Done! We finished our instructions. Sadly there are a ton more tables to do so let's call our function over and over and over again.
